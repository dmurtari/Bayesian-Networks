Bayesian-Networks
=================

Handles user queries about a disease using Bayes Nets. Currently, conditional
and marginal probabilities are working, although conditional probability 
queries always seem to return 1. The joint probability distribution would
take advantage of both the conditional and marginal probabilities to define
a recursive function to perform the joint probability calculation
